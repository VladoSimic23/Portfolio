        <p>
          I am a 36-year-old Croatian living in Bosnia and Herzegovina with 4
          years of studying a web development. I am fluent in both Croatian and
          English and have a passion for creating intuitive and engaging user
          experiences. My goal is to secure a position as a front-end developer
          where I can progress and utilize my skills to deliver exceptional
          results.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that I do not have commercial experience working as a
          full-time employee for a company, but I have gained experience through
          my personal projects and freelance work.
