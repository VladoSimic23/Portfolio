        <p>
          My name is Vladimir Šimić I am a 36-year-old Croatian living in Bosnia
          and Herzegovina. I`ve spent 4 years studying a web development. I am
          fluent in both Croatian and English and have a passion for creating
          intuitive and engaging user experiences. My goal is to secure a
          position as a front-end developer where I can progress and utilize my
          skills to deliver exceptional results.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that I do not have commercial experience working as a
          full-time employee for a company, but I have gained experience through
          my personal projects and freelance work.
